**User Story**  
As a registered user, I need to log into my account so that I can securely access my personalized dashboard and data.

**Acceptance Criteria**  
Given I am on the login page,  
When I enter valid credentials and click the "Login" button,  
Then I should be redirected to my dashboard and see my personal data.  

Given I enter invalid credentials,  
When I click "Login,"  
Then I should see an error message prompting me to try again.

**Additional Notes**  
- Add login form validation for email and password fields.  
- Store tokens securely using session storage.  
- Add “Forgot Password” link for easy password reset.  
- Estimate: 3 story points  
- Sprint/Milestone: Sprint 1 – Initial Release
